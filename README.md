# openai
My experiments with Open AI's API. 

Steps: 
1. Log into https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create an account if you havn't already. 
3. OpenAI provides a free tier with a certain number of tokens that expire after a certain time. 
4. I have a pay-as-you-go tier with a hard limit the $ amount on a monthly basis. This helps especially while experimentaing to keep costs low. 
5. Create an API Key ( Note: The API key once created is only visible one time. So make sure to keep a note of it for use later )  
6. Download the project 
7. Update the javascript file to add your API key for the 2 methods. 
8. You should be all set now. 
9. Load up the html on your broswer and start generating ðŸ¤˜. 

Below are what I generated for the following prompts: 
- Dog flying Plane
