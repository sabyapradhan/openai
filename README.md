# openai
My experiments with Open AI's API. 

Steps: 
1. Log into https://platform.openai.com/
2. Create an account if you havn't already
3. OpenAI provides a free tier with a certain number of tokens that expire after a certain time. 
4. I have a pay-as-you-go tier with a hard limit the $ amount on a monthly basis. This helps especially while experimentaing to keep costs low.
